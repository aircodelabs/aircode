In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys' fees.

1. Binding Contract. 

You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you and AirCode, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you and AirCode, and it governs your use of the Services.

2. Arbitration. 

This Section can only be amended by mutual agreement. For purposes of this Section, "Claims" means collectively, and without limitation, any and all claims, injuries, demands, liabilities, disputes, causes of action (including statutory, contract, negligence, or other tort theories), proceedings, obligations, debts, liens, fines, charges, penalties, contracts, promises, costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees, whether incurred pre-litigation, pre-trial, at trial, on appeal, or otherwise), damages of any kind whatsoever (including consequential, compensatory, or punitive damages), or losses (whether known, unknown, asserted, non-asserted, fixed, conditional, or contingent) that arise from or relate to (i) the Services, including any and all contents, materials and software related thereto, and/or (ii) your use of the Services.

If any Claim arises out of or relates to the Services or this Agreement, other than as may be provided herein, then you and AirCode agree to send notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Claim, along with a proposed resolution of it. AirCode notice to you will be sent based on the most recent contact information that you provided AirCode. If no such information exists or if such information is not current, AirCode has no obligation under this Section. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, you and AirCode will engage in a dialog to attempt to resolve the Claim, though nothing will require either you or AirCode to resolve the Claim on terms with respect to which you and AirCode, in each of the parties' sole discretion, is not comfortable.

4. Fees. 

You and AirCode will pay the administrative and arbitrator's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require AirCode to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section to be enforceable, then AirCode will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. Arbitration rules may permit AirCode to recover attorneys' fees. AirCode will not seek to recover attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.

5. Class Action Waiver. 

YOU AND AIRCODE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDING WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. 

6. Exceptions. 

Notwithstanding the agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, you or AirCode may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (including patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and moral rights, but not including privacy rights). You or AirCode may also seek relief in small claims court for Claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction. In the event that the arbitration provisions above are found not to apply to you or to a particular Claim, either as a result of your decision to opt-out of the arbitration provisions or as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you agree that the venue for any such Claim or dispute is exclusively that of a state or federal court located in San Francisco County, California. You and AirCode agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County, California for the purpose of litigating all such Claims or any other disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement or your use of the Services in the event that the arbitration provisions are found not to apply. In such a case, should AirCode prevail in litigation against you to enforce its rights under this Agreement, AirCode shall be entitled to its costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys' fees (whether incurred at or in preparation for trial, appeal or otherwise) incurred in resolving or settling the dispute, in addition to all other damages or awards to which AirCode may be entitled.
