## What are Cookies, Pixels and Local Storage?

Cookies are small files that websites place on your computer as you browse the web. Like many commercial websites, we use cookies. Cookies — and similar technologies — do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience. Cookies and other technologies may also be used to measure the effectiveness of marketing and otherwise assist us in making your use of the Platform and its features more relevant and useful to you.

Pixel tags (also known as web beacons or pixels) are small blocks of code on a web page or in an email notification. Pixels allow companies to collect information such as an individual's IP address, when the individual viewed the pixel and the type of browser used. We use pixel tags to understand whether you've interacted with content on our Platform, which helps us measure and improve our Platform and personalize your experience.
